# Day 1

Today I learnt about modules,variables,datatypes,strings

I will make 10 projects today with explanation listed below-

## Project 1 - Temperature Converter with Formatting

Write a program that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius and converts it to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Display the results using string formatting with escape sequences to make the output neat (e.g., tabs, new lines).

## Project 2 - Name Manipulator

Create a program that takes a full name as input (e.g., "john doe smith") and outputs it in the following formats:

- Title case (First letter of each word capitalized)
- All uppercase
- All lowercase
- Count of total characters (excluding spaces)
- Initials (e.g., "J.D.S.")

## Project 3 - Email Validator

- If it contains "@" symbol
- If it ends with ".com" or ".in"
- Extract and display the username (part before @)
- Extract and display the domain name (part after @)

## Project 4 - String Reverser

Create a program that takes a sentence as input and:

- Reverses the entire string
- Reverses each word individually but keeps them in the same order
- Prints every alternate character 

## Project 5 - Password Strength Checker

Write a program that takes a password as input and checks:

- Length is at least 8 characters
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Display appropriate messages for each condition

## Project 6 - Palindrome Checker
Create a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Ignore spaces and case sensitivity.

## Project 7 - Word Counter and Analyzer
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and displays:
- Total number of words
- Total number of characters (with and without spaces)

- How many times a specific word (user-provided) appears

## Project 8 - String Slicer Game
Create a program that takes a string input and asks the user for:
- Starting index
- Ending index
- Step value
- Then display the sliced string. Include error handling messages if indices are out of range.

## Project 9 - URL Parser
Write a program that takes a URL as input (e.g., "https://www.example.com/page") and extracts:
- Domain name (www.example.com)
- Path (/page)
- Check if URL uses secure connection (https)

## Project 10 - Text Formatter
