# 5 Projects on Conditionals - 

## 1. Grade Calculator
Build a program that takes a numerical score and converts it to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) with appropriate messages. Add support for plus/minus grades and handle edge cases like scores over 100 or below 0.
## 2. Movie Ticket Pricing System
Create a program that calculates movie ticket prices based on multiple factors: age (child, adult, senior discounts), day of the week (weekend vs weekday pricing), time of day (morning vs evening), and membership status. Use nested conditionals to apply the correct discounts and display the final price with a breakdown.
## 3. Simple Calculator with Error Handling
Develop a calculator that performs basic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user choice. Include conditionals to handle division by zero, invalid operations, and non-numeric inputs with helpful error messages.
## 4. BMI Calculator with Health Advice
Calculate Body Mass Index from height and weight, then use conditionals to categorize the result (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) and provide personalized health recommendations for each category.
## 5. Rock Paper Scissors Game
Build a game against the computer with input validation, win/loss/tie detection, and score tracking. Add conditionals for invalid inputs and options to play again or view statistics.
