## 5 Advanced Level Projets on Data structures - 

## 1.Personal Expense Tracker
 Build a command-line tool where users can add expenses, categorize them, and view spending summaries. Use dictionaries to store expense categories and amounts, lists for transaction history, sets to track unique categories, and tuples for immutable transaction records (date, amount, category).
## 2.Student Grade Management System 
Create a system to manage student records and calculate statistics. Use dictionaries for student profiles (name: grades), lists to store individual test scores, tuples for immutable student IDs and personal info, and sets to find unique courses or identify students meeting certain criteria.
## 3.Contact Book with Duplicate Detection 
Design a contact management app that prevents duplicate entries. Use dictionaries for storing contacts (name: details), sets to detect duplicate phone numbers or emails, lists for contact history or groups, and tuples to store immutable contact information like (name, phone, email).
## 4.Text Analyzer and Word Frequency Counter 
Build a tool that analyzes text files or user input. Use dictionaries to count word frequencies, sets to find unique words, lists to preserve word order for context analysis, and tuples to store immutable metadata like (filename, word_count, line_count).
## 5.Movie Recommendation System (Basic) 
Create a simple recommendation engine based on user preferences. Use dictionaries to map movies to genres and ratings, sets to find common genres between users, lists to rank recommendations, and tuples to store movie details like (title, year, genre).
