# Day-4

## 3 Advanced Level Projets on Data structures - 

## 1.Personal Expense Tracker
 Build a command-line tool where users can add expenses, categorize them, and view spending summaries. Use dictionaries to store expense categories and amounts, sets to track unique categories, and tuples for immutable transaction records (date, amount, category).
## 2.Student Grade Management System 
Create a system to manage student records and calculate statistics. Use dictionaries for student profiles (name: grades), lists to store individual test scores, tuples for immutable student IDs and personal info.
## 3.Contact Book with Duplicate Detection 
Design a contact management app that prevents duplicate entries. Use dictionaries for storing contacts (name: details), sets to detect duplicate phone numbers or emails, tuples to store immutable contact information like (name, phone, email).
