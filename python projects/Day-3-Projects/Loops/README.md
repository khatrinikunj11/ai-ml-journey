## 5 Projects on Loops - 

## 6. Number Guessing Game
Create a game where the computer picks a random number and the player guesses it. Use a loop to allow multiple attempts, provide "higher/lower" hints, track the number of guesses, and offer to play again when finished.
## 7. Multiplication Table Generator
Build a program that generates multiplication tables for any number up to a user-specified range. Use nested loops to create formatted tables and allow users to generate multiple tables in one session.
## 8. Prime Number Finder
Write a program that finds all prime numbers within a given range. Use loops to check divisibility and optimize by only checking up to the square root of each number. Display results and show the count of primes found.
## 9. Pattern Printer
Create various patterns using nested loops, such as pyramids, diamonds, number triangles, or Floyd's triangle. Let users choose the pattern type and size, then generate it using asterisks, numbers, or other characters.
## 10. Simple ATM Simulator
Simulate an ATM with a menu loop that allows checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing transaction history. Use loops for the main menu and validation loops to ensure valid inputs for amounts and choices.
